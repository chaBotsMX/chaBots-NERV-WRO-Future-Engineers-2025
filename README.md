### 4.3. LIDAR Sector Analysis System (Python)

Our LIDAR system provides 360¬∞ environmental awareness with sector-based analysis:

```python
class LidarSectorAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.target_angles = [0, 90, 180, 270]  # Cardinal directions
        self.angle_tolerance = 5                 # ¬±5¬∞ sector width
        self.sector_data = {angle: [] for angle in self.target_angles}
```

The Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor provides precise position and heading data:

```python
def runExample():
    myOtos = qwiic_otos.QwiicOTOS()
    myOtos.begin()
    myOtos.calibrateImu()
    myOtos.resetTracking()

    while True:
        myPosition = myOtos.getPosition()
        # Returns X, Y coordinates in inches and heading in degrees
```

**Capabilities:**
- Sub-millimeter position accuracy

## 5. Mobility Management <a name="mobility-management"></a>

### 5.1. Gearbox:
<img src="https://github.com/chaBotsMX/chaBots-NERV-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/docs-nacional/models/gearbox/gearbox-assemble.png?raw=true.png">

**Motor Model:** Maxon DCX19
The team opted for custom steel shafts with a 4 mm diameter, which were connected to a Maxon DCX19 motor. This motor provided sufficient power and torque to meet the project's performance requirements, with a maximum speed of 600 RPM. The gear ratio between the motor and the output gear is 1:1, as higher speeds were not required at the time.
The transmission base and gears were designed and manufactured by the team. To maximize strength and durability, Polymaker PTG CF filament was used on a Creality K2 Plus Combo printer. To improve efficiency and reduce mechanical wear, double helical gears were designed and printed.
The steel shafts were manually sized from steel rod. These were cut to the required length and, using a Dremel tool, shaped into a D-shape to ensure a firm grip with the wheel hubs. The rear wheels were also custom-made with a 3D-printed D-shaped axle for secure fit.


### 5.2. Steering System
<img src="https://github.com/chaBotsMX/chaBots-NERV-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/docs-nacional/models/steering-system/steering-system-assembly.png?raw=true">

**Servo Model:** HS 85mg
For the steering system, the goal was to make the mechanism as simple as possible, as this would allow for quick and easy manufacturing. It was decided to mount the HS 85mg servo on a 3D-designed and printed base, just like all the other components. The servo is connected to the beam that connects to the wheel mounts. These mounts are made to fit a LEGO axle without slipping.
For the front wheels, the team used LEGO Spike rubber tires after determining that manufacturing them in-house was not feasible.

### 5.3. Chasis
<img src="https://github.com/chaBotsMX/chaBots-NERV-WRO-Future-Engineers-2025/blob/docs-nacional/models/v-assembly.png?raw=true">
The chassis is the robot's main structure, as all other systems are mounted on it. A modular design was chosen to facilitate assembly and maintenance. The chassis is made of carbon fiber, which was cut in China.
The steering system is mounted on the chassis using 20mm-high M3 posts. The odometer PCB is anchored below the steering system, as this makes better use of space. The gearbox is mounted directly to the rear of the chassis, and the Raspberry Pi 5 is mounted on it using 20mm-high M2.5 posts. The main PCB is mounted in the middle, and the Lidar base is mounted on 20mm-high M3 posts. The Raspberry Pi camera v2 base is mounted on the Lidar base using 40mm-high M3 posts.
Using these poles helped us keep the robot as low as possible, allowing the Lidar sensor to be level with the runway walls.
