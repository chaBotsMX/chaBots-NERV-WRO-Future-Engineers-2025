qwiic_sgp40
===========
Python module for the SparkFun Air Quality Sensor - SGP40 (Qwiic).

This package is a port of the existing [SparkFun SGP40 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SGP40_Arduino_Library) and is heavily based on the driver written by [DFRobot](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_SGP40/tree/master/Python/raspberrypi).

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun Qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)
